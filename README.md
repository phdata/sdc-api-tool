# Pipeline Utils
A set of utilities to help with management of Streamsets pipelines.

## Configuration
#### sdc-hosts.yml
Create a YAML file called `sdc-hosts.yml` in the root of the project and fill in with details of the
instances you plan to use with these utilities.  See the `template-sdc-hosts.yml` for an example of
the required formatting.

#### creds.yml
Create a YAML file called `creds.yml` in the root of the project and fill in with credentials of the
instances you plan to use with these utilities.  See the `template-creds.yml` for an example of
the required formatting.

## Promote
#### Purpose
This script is indented to migrate one pipeline from one SDC environment to another. SDC administrator
credentials are required to execute these commands. The script will prompt the user to enter both
the source and destination credentials (format = username:password). If a `destPipelineId` is not 
specified, a new pipeline will be created with the same name and description as the exported pipeline.
Currently, origin offset values are not part of the exported configuration, so no manipulation of the
destination's offset is required.

#### Usage
The script includes help docs with details on the script arguments, but here is an example of calling 
it from the shell:

#### Promote Pipeline
```bash
sdc-util pipeline promote --src dev \
  --srcPipelineId ESImport77337a4f-74c5-45d1-91fd-7ce746f1bdfd \
  --dest stage \
  --destPipelineId ESImport48b1200f-c270-4937-a226-b3443ce850f3` 
```
#### Export Pipeline

```bash
sdc-util pipeline export --src dev \
  --out sdc.json \
  --pipelineId StreamManagerConsumerV06fa7c3d3-458f-4446-9f51-398899118b73
```
#### Import Pipeline
```bash
sdc-util pipeline import --dest production \
  --pipelineJson testpipeline.json \
  --pipelineId firstpipe
```

#### Start Pipeline
```bash
sdc-util pipeline start \
  --pipelineId firstpipe \
  --host production
```

#### Stop Pipeline
```bash
sdc-util pipeline stop \
  --pipelineId firstpipe \
  --host production
```
